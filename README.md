## Overview
**WeatherCloset** is a mobile application designed to help users categorize and recognize items based on weather conditions. Weâ€™re building this using cutting-edge technologies, including **Dart**, **Flutter**, **TensorFlow**, **Firebase**, and **Firestore**. The goal is to create a seamless experience for users to get intelligent suggestions about clothing based on weather data.

## Technologies
- **Dart** & **Flutter**: For building the mobile application.
- **Firebase & Firestore**: For backend services, data storage, and real-time updates.
